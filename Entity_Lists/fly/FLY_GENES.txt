FBgn0037324	Orco	Odorant receptor co-receptor	20160623	Odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) is a broadly expressed in the chemosensory organs, where it forms heteromultimeric complexes with ligand-selective odorant receptors (ORs).  Orco serves dual role as a chaperone for cell surface expression of the OR/Orco complex as well as being integral to the function of the olfactory receptor complex. Orco does not itself respond to olfactory ligands, but is thought to contribute to the putative ion-conducting pore.
